	<h1>Time, Space, Complexity</h1>
	<div>
		<p>Time complexity, efficient: Time complexity is a way of showing how the runtime of a function increases as the size of the input increases. It describes the amount of computer time it takes to run a function.</p>
	
		<p><b>Space Complexity,</b> O(n) refers to the amount of memory used by an algorithm or a program during its execution. Time complexity, on the other hand, refers to the amount of time it takes for an algorithm or program to complete its execution.
